   <main>
      <p>I am just a peaceful young monk who lived with his masters at the northern air temple.
      I have tatoos that symbolize my profecieny with the art of airbending but far greater things were written for my future.
      After learning of my destiny as the avatar, I ran away not knowing of the impending fire nation attack on my people.
      While running away, my bison and I weren caught in a storm and ultimately frozen in ice for a century.
      After disappearing from the world for a 100 years, it is my job as the avatar to learn the 4 elements, restore balance,
      and bring order to the world. </p>
