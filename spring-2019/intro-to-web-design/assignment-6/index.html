      <p>Unfortunatly, antisemitism has turned into a major issue in America.        <q>Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.</q>
        There are two notable attacks which you can read about from the above links.
        However, the biggest problem is that government leaders and the 3 branches are
        not using the full force of their power to squash the brewing hatred and
        deter other hate crimes being commited against those of the Jewish faith.
